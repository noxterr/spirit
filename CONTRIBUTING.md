## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please create an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/noxterr/spirit/issues).

## Style Guide

- Follow the existing code style. It should align with PHPCS guides (such as parenthesis on new lines and a space after `!`)
- Write clear and concise commit messages. A comment after it is always welcome.
- Include comments on code that isn't self-explanatory.

## Testing

At this time I haven't setup any testing. If this was to change, any PR should not break any existing testing.

Thank you for your contributions!
